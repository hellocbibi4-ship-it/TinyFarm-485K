# TinyFarm Project - L2 Informatique

Welcome to the **TinyFarm** project repository. This project is part of the L2 Computer Science curriculum (XLG4IU050 - Client-side Web Development) at Nantes University.

## 🐄 Project Overview
TinyFarm is a web-based farming simulation game. Players start with a loan of **1,500 écus** and must manage their farm (cows, chickens, rabbits) to produce goods and eventually repay their debt.
